## Overview

This project is Proof of Concept (PoC) for Spring Event Driven Architecture (EDA).

Spring Framework provides built-in support for event-driven architecture through the ApplicationContext.

Baseline Spring Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is composed of the following components:
- Custom Events
- Event Publishers
- Event Listeners
- Configuring the Application Context

### Custom Events
In Spring, you can create custom events by extending the **ApplicationEvent** class.

### Event Publishers
To publish events, you need to use the **ApplicationEventPublisher** interface, which can be injected into your classes using Springâ€™s dependency injection. 

You can then call the *publishEvent()* method to send your custom event to all interested listeners.

### Event Listeners
To consume events, you create event listener methods and annotate them with **@EventListener**. 
These methods will be executed whenever an event of the specified type is published.

### Configuring the Application Context
To enable event-driven architecture in your Spring application, you need to configure the Application Context. 

Ensure that your event publisher, custom events, and event listeners are registered as beans in the context.
